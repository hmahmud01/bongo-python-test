Documentation:
1. q1.py includes the solution for first print_depth function which will take a dictionary and prints only the keys with the depth level.
2. q2.py includes the solution for a depth printer which can print depth with the key from a dictionary and can take a class object and interate over the class object with current depth level.
3. q3.py includes the least common ancestor problem.

Instructions to Execute the problem:
1. clone the repo.
2. run "python -m main" to see the results from the function with sample dataset. 
3. run "python -m unittest" to see the testresults.


Least Common Ancestor problem (q3):
Both time complexity and space complexity for this problem will be O(n) since this solution only functions with single traverse within the full binary tree.
